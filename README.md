# Hello-World

Hi Humans of both Gender!
My name is Peter but you can call me pete. I am a grade 7 student of CFA homeschool.
I started to code cause i think it would give me satisfaction and relief. 
And it turns out it was really fun so was thinking of coding every time on my free time. 
After 5 years i see myself with alot of people asking for autograph and i'm really famous.(I hope this would happen)
